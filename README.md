# Machine Learning-Based Evaluation of Hematological Parameters as Predictors of CD4⁺ T-Cell Count and Plasma HIV RNA in People Living with HIV (PLWH)


This repository contains data analysis pipelines, machine learning models, and evaluation scripts for predicting CD4⁺ T-cell counts and plasma HIV RNA viral load levels from 
routine hematological parameters in PLWH. The study aims to identify cost-effective, non-invasive surrogate markers for immunological and virological monitoring using supervised learning algorithms.
