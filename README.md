# Machine Learning-Based Evaluation of Hematological Parameters as Predictors of CD4⁺ T-Cell Count and Plasma HIV RNA in People Living with HIV (PLWH)
This repository contains data analysis pipelines, machine learning models, and evaluation scripts for predicting CD4⁺ T-cell counts and plasma HIV RNA viral load levels from routine hematological parameters in PLWH. The study aims to identify cost-effective, non-invasive surrogate markers for immunological and virological monitoring using supervised learning algorithms.

Key Features:

Preprocessing of clinical and laboratory datasets

Feature engineering and selection

Supervised ML models (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost, SVM, etc.)

Regression and classification tasks

Model performance evaluation (MAE, R², AUC, etc.)

Visualization of correlations, feature importances, and diagnostic thresholds

Applications:

Low-resource HIV care settings

Monitoring ART effectiveness

Enhancing personalized HIV treatment strategies
